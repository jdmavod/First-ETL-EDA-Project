A project that used a dataset that included information on mass layoffs across a wide variety of companies, from large to small. The dates covered in this project were those during which the world was affected by COVID-19, in order to show how this impacted industries.

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages" and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect. Hope you dig it :)
