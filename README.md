My first guided project that used a dataset wich included information on mass layoffs across a wide variety of companies, from large to small. The dates covered in this project were those during which the world was affected by COVID-19 in order to show how this impacted industries.

## Dataset <a id="dataset"></a>
The dataset used was one from the youtuber Alex The Analyst, heres the link to the dataset (https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/MySQL-YouTube-Series/blob/main/layoffs.csv). From here I followed along starting from understanding the queries to applying them. This was my first introduccion to MySQL and it felt really smooth. I learned all the basics to some intermidiate queries like using CTE's.

## Goals <a id="goals"></a>
The main objective of this guided project was to learn the basics of SQL, from SELECT and FROM statements to advanced queries such as using CTEs and different types of JOINS. As a secondary objective, an exploratory data analysis was performed using the already cleaned data from the dataset to draw some conclusions and answer various questions.

## Contribution <a id="contribution"></a>
This project was my first in the field of data analysis. The work reflected here was my first personal project, where I learned a lot about the basics of SQL and Power BI. If you think anything you see here might help you, feel free to fork it for your own use.

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages" and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect. Hope you dig it :)
